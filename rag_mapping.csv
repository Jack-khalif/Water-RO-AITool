Dear Sir/Madam,
PROPOSAL FOR SUPPLY AND INSTALLATION OF WATER TREATMENT PLANT
Following the inquiry regarding the above, Davis and Shirtliff wish to present a proposal, terms, and
conditions for a solution to treat the client’s borehole water for domestic drinking and use in the
laboratory.
1 CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS
Based on the requirement Davis and Shirtliff have provided a water treatment system that can treat
250 litres/hr for domestic use.
1.1 SITE CONDITIONS
The water analysis report from Davis & Shirtliff Laboratory (Lab Sample ID: 10/24/RO/2376, dated
10th October, 2024) indicates that all tested parameters were within acceptable limits.
Parameter Unit Results WHO Standards
pH 6.13 6.5-8.5
Total Suspended Solids Mg/l 15 NIL
Turbidity Mg/l 5.1 <5
Manganese Mg/L 0.73 <0.1
Total Hardness Mg/l 403 <300
Bicarbonates Mg/l 321 <255
2 PROPOSED SOLUTION
Davis & Shirtliff proposes a treatment plant designed to provide a net flow rate of 0.2",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"5 m³/hr as
requested by the client.
Below are the unit treatment processes involved.
● Chlorination and oxidation
● Filtration - Removal of suspended matter, turbidity, and colour
● Reverse Osmosis - Removal of Dissolved salts
● Post disinfection- Chlorination
Page 1 of 6",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"Proposed Treatment Layout
Proposed Treatment Process
● The incoming water from the borehole shall be dosed with ph plus to adjust the pH to the
acceptable levels and chlorine to oxidize and precipitate any dissolved iron and manganese as it
goes into an aeration tank (Client’s Scope).
● In the aeration tank, dissolved iron and manganese are further oxidized through the injection of
air into the water through the air distribution system.
● From the aeration tank, the water overflows into a clarifier tank (Client’s Scope) to allow
sedimentation of any suspended particle in the water including the precipitated iron and
manganese.
● The water will then be filtered through PXD Media filter charged with glass to remove the
suspended particles and reduce the turbidity to the acceptable before it goes through the
Activated Carbon filter to remove any residual chlorine that may damage the RO membranes.
● To prevent scaling of the RO membranes, it will be important to dose an antiscalant into th",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"e
water before the water goes into the RO. Genesys antiscalant will, therefore, be continuously
added to the system before the RO.
● The treated water will be dosed with a chlorine for disinfection before storage (Client's scope).
3 EQUIPMENT
For the above scope, the treatment system will include the supply of the following treatment stages.
a. Dayliff Filters – Dayliff PXD Industrial media filters are
specifically designed for filtration applications where higher
levels of operating pressure and reliability are demanded.
The filter will be charged with glass media of different grades
for sediment removal.
2
Page 2 of 6",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"b. Airmac DBMX single-phase air
The Airmac DBMX Single-phase air blower shall be used
to pump air from the atmosphere and through the pipes,
diffuser, and into the water for aeration.
Equipped with built-in protection devices, safety switches,
and thermostats, to protect pumps from any unpredictable
diaphragm breaks.
c. Disc Diffusers
The disc diffuser bubbles air into the water. They have
multiple air-release orifices resulting in improved oxygen
transfer efficiency
d. Reverse Osmosis Unit – Reverse Osmosis (DRO4) is a
process in which purified water (permeate) is produced from
the feed water via the rejection of all organic and inorganic
constituents by a semi-permeable membrane system. The
RO system separates the incoming feed stream into two
effluent streams:
The permeate (treated water) passes through Reverse
Osmosis membranes and thus contains greatly reduced
quantities of dissolved mineral salts and organics for use
(typically ≥ 96% rejection ratio). A ratio of permeate to feed
",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"water gives the system recovery. The designed recovery of the
RO machine is estimated at 45- 50% depending on raw water
feed parameters.
The concentrate (reject water) is the stream that passes
tangentially across the membrane surface and thus retains the
impurities separated from the permeate stream. A certain
minimum flow of ‘concentrate’ is necessary to keep the RO
membranes from ‘fouling’ due to the removed mineral salts and
organic contents.

7 CONDITION
Please note the following:
a. Offer Price: Prices quoted are in Kenya Shillings and are inclusive of VAT. Where further site
assessment is required to verify the details, a conclusive quotation will have to be provided and
confirmed by the client before the commencement of work.
b. Delivery and Offloading: The proposed plant will be delivered using a crane truck. The process
involves moving the truck across a lawn or lose ground, ther",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"e could be damage caused to the
ground owing to the weight of the truck. It will be the responsibility of others to make good any
such damage.
c. Drilling and Welding: The nature of the work may further involve drilling on walls to mount the
changeover panel. This may require the D&S team to access the client’s main supply.
d. System Design: The water treatment system is designed to perform optimally based on best
design practices and computer simulations performed on the results of a water analysis report
which has been provided. While in most cases, the equipment performance matches the output

Page 5 of 6",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"of the design and simulations, the Purchaser accepts that environmental factors may result in
water quality change leading to a difference between the actual plant output and that predicted
during design. Long-term performance can therefore only be accurately determined during plant
operation on the ground. Predicted water quality results before installation can only be used as
an indicator of expected plant performance and the Seller, therefore, reserves the right to
recommend further design changes and additional works as necessary if the water quality
changes after installation or is discovered to be different during installation, cost of which shall
be borne by the Purchaser.
e. Consumables- Cartridges/bag filters, membranes, and required chemicals are consumables
and shall require periodic replacement and replenishment depending on water quality.
f. Permeate Output: The consistency of this output is based on proper operation, maintenance,
and keeping of logs of the plant, and cons",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf
"istency in the quality of the incoming (feed) water.
Should the incoming water degrade further, the output of the plant may decline, and a new
design would be needed whose costs would be shared with the Purchaser.
8 DELIVERY
Please allow for 3-4 weeks for fabrication and assembly. The delivery period above is subject to
prior sale and the stock availability of components.
9 TAXES
The above notwithstanding, please note that should the statutory tax rates (e.g. VAT/ Import duty)
change from the current rate at the time of order confirmation, receipt of goods, or invoicing, the
supplier reserves the right to adjust the prices by the new ruling rate at that time.
10 PAYMENT
