Dosing Tanks
DAYLIFF chemical tanks are specially designed for use in dosing applications of various concentrate chemicals. They are made
from strong corrosion resistant GRP and are available in various sizes according to applications. All are provided with a reinforced
top to support a dosage pump mixer, an inspection/filling cover and a graduated chemical volume scale. A variety of dosage
pumps are available to suit the dosage requirement.
Also available are hand and electric mixer options to provide chemical concentrate consistency. Electric mixers are of low speed
200rpm type and specification includes a 120W geared motor and PVC shaft with paddle and they are suitable for low and medium
viscosity liquids. Two models are available with 150mm and 220mm paddle diameter depending upon the dosage tank size. Hand
mixers are made from PVC and include a V-shaped mixing plate and a lever handle.

varying stroke frequency according to the input signals sent from the analysers. These pumps are mounted on the chemical solution

Dayliff TuriTap is a drinking water chlorination technology which accurately doses liquid chlorine into water using the venturi
principle which does not require electricity for operation. TuriTap can be installed on existing faucet or tap connections, such as
from piped water, storage tanks, water kiosks, schools, and healthcare facilities. The outlet of the spout can be connected to a short
hose (<1 meter), attached to direct flow into water containers. Connecting the outlet to a longer pipe can cause dosing
inaccuracies. Dosing automatically adjusts with varying flow rates from 0.03 to 3.6m3/hr using the venturi principle. Chlorine
concentration can be further adjusted using the TuriTap needle valve to provide an adequate level of treatment while meeting taste
and required free chlorine level preferences. Liquid chlorine concentrations from 0.5% to 6.0% are preferred over powder or
granular based chlorine which if not well mix",reference_docs\data\Chemical Dosage\Turitap Chlorine Doser_turitap.pdf#page=1

The system is designed for gravity water flow installation such as the water dispenser ATMs, water vendor kiosks, community-based

tank that supplies liquid chlorine to a float tank connected to the venturi system.

PUMP
The DAYLIFF DDG pump is of single stage centrifugal impeller self priming design suitable for small scale irrigation, water boosting
and water transfer applications. Materials of construction are AISI304 stainless steel for the pump body, shaft and back plate with
the impeller made from polypropylene. The pump is provided with a handle for easy portability, priming screw and a drain plug.
Also available is the ‘AutoPress’ automatic booster system which incorporates a 19L horizontal diaphragm tank, pressure switch
and pressure gauge for automatic pump operation.
MOTOR
Pumps incorporate a TEFC motor with built-in thermal overload protection. The motor can be connected to mains electrical supply
through a 10A fuse or MCB, though additional protection is recommended where there is risk of voltage fluctuation.

PUMPS
DAYLIFF DSmart Pumps are innovative centrifugal self-priming variable speed automatic water boosting systems for pressurised water supply, variable
speed technology providing constant pressure at varying water demand levels. Pump construction is engineering plastic throughout except DSmart750
which has stainless steel pump body with external casings made from UV proof components suitable for indoor and outdoor installations. Particular
features include:-
• Innovative inverter controlled variable",reference_docs\data\Domestic Pumps\DSmart.pdf#page=1
" speed technology that minimises energy consumption.
• Quiet operation with max noise levels of 50dB.
• Fully automatic operation with adjustable constant pressure settings that matches flow with demand.
• Easy to use LED control panel with display for operating mode, operating pressure and various fault indicators.
• Convenience features including standard inlet and outlet connectors and inbuilt non-return valve.
• High/Low temperature protection and leakage warning.
• Integrated pressure tank for dry running and anti-cycling protection.
• Parallel connection for 2 pump operation available for DSmart1500
DSmart are exceptionally advanced pumps that use state of the art inverter technology to provide the perfect solution for a complete water supply system in
domestic, residential and small commercial water supply applications.
MOTORS
Pumps are fitted with high efficiency IE5 Permanent Magnet variable frequency motor that incorporates thermal protection against motor overload and dry

1 Standard filter specification. Greater pressure capacities are available if required.
2. Maximum capacity is rated at 40m/hr, standard capacity at 20m/hr and minimum
capacity at10m/hr filtration velocities. Equipment flow rates should be set on the
basis of medium specification and raw water quality. Advice should be taken from the
equipment supplier.
3. Operating weight includes media and water.
The DAYLIFF 'FC' range of pressure sand filters are proven and reliable designs for general water treatment and swimming pool
applications. They are available in standard capacities up to 170m3/hr, though greater capacities can be provided by the
installation of a number of filters in parallel. Features include:-
• A selection of eight standard models available in different diameters, the smaller diameters being supplied in standard and
deep bed configurations.
• Mild steel plate construction with",reference_docs\data\Filters and Softeners\FC Filters.pdf#page=1
" domed ends for enhanced pressure capacity with optional heavier gauge steel plate being
offered for high-pressure applications. Stainless steel is also available for specialised food grade installations.
• Suitable for various medias including silica sand for sediment removal activated carbon for taste, odour and chlorine
removal, activated carbon for fluoride removal and anion resin for softening.
• 400mm diameter bolted access cover for easy media charging and removal. Deep bed filters also feature a low-level side
cover to facilitate media removal and general internal maintenance.
• Standard internal bitumised coating for corrosion protection and long life. A GRP lining is optional for aggressive liquids.
• High efficiency internal distribution and collection manifolds to ensure even filtration throughout the filter area and effective
backwash flows.

Multiple connection installation options are available including series connection for increased filtration performance and parallel
connection for high flow rates.
For the successful application of pressure filters it is important to match media and flow rate to the quality of the incoming water.
Technical advice is available on correct specifications for individual applications.
The DAYLIFF range of pressure filters are established products which have been progressively upgraded over many years of
production. They are robust, reliable and effective and offer the ideal solution for a wide range of water treatment requirements.

Reverse Osmosis is a proven technology to remove dissolved solids in water. At the heart of the system is the membrane, though the
effectiveness of treatment relies on the correct matching of all components to provide an efficient treatment process, DAYLIFF plants being
carefully engineered to provide reliability with the highest treated water quality.
Systems are frame mounted with all components conveniently accessible and are designed to provide low energy consumption and long
life. Standard models are suitable for low (up to 2000ppm) and medium (up to 5000ppm) brackish water applications though systems for
treating higher salinity levels and sea water are available to special order. All offer the following features:-
• High efficiency 4” RO membranes specified to suit water quality housed in strong, corrosion proof FRP pressure vessels.
• High treatment performance with up to 98% salts rejection
• High pressure in line multi stage stainless steel feed pump
• System monitoring accessories including inlet and outlet flow meters, pressure gauges and conductivity meter
• Electronic controller for fully automated plant operation including startup, periodic flush cycle and shut down as well as providing
various system alarms
• Sediment removal and Carbon cartridge pre-filters
• Skid mounted for simple installation
• Corrosion resistant stainless steel high pressure and plastic low pressure pipes and pipe fittings.
DAYLIFF RO plants are highly efficient, easy to operate and simple to maintain and offer the ideal solution for small and medium scale
Reverse Osmosis requirements.
Solar Power Option is available on request.
