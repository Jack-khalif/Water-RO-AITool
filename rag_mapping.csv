Reverse Osmosis is a proven technology to remove dissolved solids in water. At the heart of the system is the membrane, though the
effectiveness of treatment relies on the correct matching of all components to provide an efficient treatment process, DAYLIFF plants
being carefully engineered to provide reliability with the highest treated water quality.
Systems are frame mounted with all components conveniently accessible and are designed to provide low energy consumption and
long life. Standard models are suitable for low (up to 2000ppm) and medium (up to 5000ppm) brackish water applications though
systems for treating higher salinity levels and sea water are available to special order. All offer the following features:-
• High efficiency 8” RO membranes specified to suit the water quality housed in strong, corrosion proof GRP pressure vessels.
• High treatment performance with up to 98% salts rejection
• High pressure in line multi stage stainless steel feed pump
• System monitoring accessories including inlet and outlet flow meters, pressure gauges and conductivity meter
• Electronic controller for fully automated plant operation including startup, periodic flush cycle and shut down as well as
providing various system alarms
• Sediment removal cartridge pre-filters
• Skid mounted for simple installation
• Corrosion resistant stainless steel high pressure and plastic low pressure pipes and pipe fittings.
All DAYLIFF RO plants are highly efficient, easy to operate and simple to maintain and offer the ideal solution for small and medium
scale Reverse Osmosis requirements.
Solar Power option is available on request.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Raw Water Quality: TDS level of up to 2,000ppm for the Low Brackish Water and up to 5,000ppm for the Medium Brackish
Water Plant, Chloride level should be less than 350ppm, no chlorine, total hardness <200ppm and no suspended solids. A raw
water analysis should be provided to establish the extent of pre-treatment necessary.
Normal Rejection: 95%-98%
Water Temperature: 5-350C, Design Temperature 250C
Minimum Inlet Pressure: 3bar
Operating Pressure: Ranges between 4 bar and 20 bar depending on raw water quality
Recovery Range: 35% - 75% depending on raw water quality. System recovery is entirely dependent on water quality; higher
TDS or silt content will reduce the recovery rate and flow rates.

PUMP
The DAYLIFF DDG pump is of single stage centrifugal impeller self priming design suitable for small scale irrigation, water boosting
and water transfer applications. Materials of construction are AISI304 stainless steel for the pump body, shaft and back plate with
the impeller made from polypropylene. The pump is provided with a handle for easy portability, priming screw and a drain plug.
Also available is the ‘AutoPress’ automatic booster system which incorporates a 19L horizontal diaphragm tank, pressure switch
and pressure gauge for automatic pump operation.
MOTOR
Pumps incorporate a TEFC motor with built-in thermal overload protection. The motor can be connected to mains electrical supply
through a 10A fuse or MCB, though additional protection is recommended where there is risk of voltage fluctuation.

Dear Sir/Madam,
PROPOSAL FOR SUPPLY AND INSTALLATION OF WATER TREATMENT PLANT
Following the inquiry regarding the above, Davis and Shirtliff wish to present a proposal, terms, and
conditions for a solution to treat the client’s borehole water for domestic drinking and use in the
laboratory.
1 CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS
Based on the requirement Davis and Shirtliff have provided a water treatment system that can treat
250 litres/hr for domestic use.
1.1 SITE CONDITIONS
The water analysis report from Davis & Shirtliff Laboratory (Lab Sample ID: 10/24/RO/2376, dated
10th October, 2024) indicates that all tested parameters were within acceptable limits.
Parameter Unit Results WHO Standards
pH 6.13 6.5-8.5
Total Suspended Solids Mg/l 15 NIL
Turbidity Mg/l 5.1 <5
Manganese Mg/L 0.73 <0.1
Total Hardness Mg/l 403 <300
Bicarbonates Mg/l 321 <255
2 PROPOSED SOLUTION
Davis & Shirtliff proposes a treatment plant designed to provide a net flow rate of 0.2",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf#page=1
"5 m³/hr as
requested by the client.
Below are the unit treatment processes involved.
● Chlorination and oxidation
● Filtration - Removal of suspended matter, turbidity, and colour
● Reverse Osmosis - Removal of Dissolved salts
● Post disinfection- Chlorination

"Proposed Treatment Layout
Proposed Treatment Process
● The incoming water from the borehole shall be dosed with ph plus to adjust the pH to the
acceptable levels and chlorine to oxidize and precipitate any dissolved iron and manganese as it
goes into an aeration tank (Client’s Scope).
● In the aeration tank, dissolved iron and manganese are further oxidized through the injection of
air into the water through the air distribution system.
● From the aeration tank, the water overflows into a clarifier tank (Client’s Scope) to allow
sedimentation of any suspended particle in the water including the precipitated iron and
manganese.
● The water will then be filtered through PXD Media filter charged with glass to remove the
suspended particles and reduce the turbidity to the acceptable before it goes through the
Activated Carbon filter to remove any residual chlorine that may damage the RO membranes.
● To prevent scaling of the RO membranes, it will be important to dose an antiscalant into th",reference_docs\sample proposal.docx.pdf#page=2
"e
water before the water goes into the RO. Genesys antiscalant will, therefore, be continuously
added to the system before the RO.
● The treated water will be dosed with a chlorine for disinfection before storage (Client's scope).
3 EQUIPMENT
For the above scope, the treatment system will include the supply of the following treatment stages.
a. Dayliff Filters – Dayliff PXD Industrial media filters are
specifically designed for filtration applications where higher
levels of operating pressure and reliability are demanded.
The filter will be charged with glass media of different grades
for sediment removal.

"of the design and simulations, the Purchaser accepts that environmental factors may result in
water quality change leading to a difference between the actual plant output and that predicted
during design. Long-term performance can therefore only be accurately determined during plant
operation on the ground. Predicted water quality results before installation can only be used as
an indicator of expected plant performance and the Seller, therefore, reserves the right to
recommend further design changes and additional works as necessary if the water quality
changes after installation or is discovered to be different during installation, cost of which shall
be borne by the Purchaser.
e. Consumables- Cartridges/bag filters, membranes, and required chemicals are consumables
and shall require periodic replacement and replenishment depending on water quality.

Should the incoming water degrade further, the output of the plant may decline, and a new

8 DELIVERY
Please allow for 3-4 weeks for fabrication and assembly. The delivery period above is subject to
prior sale and the stock availability of components.
9 TAXES
The above notwithstanding, please note that should the statutory tax rates (e.g. VAT/ Import duty)
change from the current rate at the time of order confirmation, receipt of goods, or invoicing, the
supplier reserves the right to adjust the prices by the new ruling rate at that time.
10 PAYMENT
Davis & Shirtliff proposes a 100% payment on the order confirmation. However, the supplier is open
to discussions to reach mutually agreeable terms.
Note; Customer financing options are also available upon request.

12 FORCE MAJEURE
This proposal is for all intents and purposes executable subject to “Force Majeure” events which
cannot reasonably be avoided by the supplier's diligent observation under circumstances, which are

herein impossible or so impractical as reasonably to be considered impossible in the circumstances.
Such events include but are not limited to viral epidemics, war, riots, civil disorder, earthquake,
storm, flood or adverse weather conditions, strikes, lockouts or other industrial action, terrorist acts,
acts of piracy, confiscation, or any other action by government agencies.

• Scaling
o Precipitation of solutes onto membrane surface
o Occurs at tail end
o Heavy metals, Silica, Hardness etc

and dosage simulator available from Genesys (MM5)
• Fouling
o Growth of bacteria on membrane surface forming slime layer
o Occurs throughout membrane
o COD & BOD
• Clogging
o Deposits of silt in membrane
o Throughout membrane but most common at front.
o Metal Oxides, TSS (colloids, clays, silts, etc.)
